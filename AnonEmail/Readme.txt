	Set these pages up on a server somewhere on the net. Access them and you
will have an anonymous emailer.  Set any email address you want.  Some 
email servers won't accept the bogus address but some will.  Just play with
it and give it a chance.  This code is for learning purposes only.
The original intent of this was to create a paging type service between
friends.  Please do not use this code for illegal purposes.  Authors of
this code are not responsible for any illegal use of this code.

- P.S.  SMTP Services must be running on the host machine in order
for the code to work properly.	</font>
